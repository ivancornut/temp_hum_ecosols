# Accurate air temperature and humidity measurement
The aim of this project is to build an accurate air temperature and humidity sensor for environmental science. We will be using the SHT45 sensor from sensirion since it presents the right accuracy, precicison and drift for the job. Due to its use outdoors we will use the version equipped with a PTFE filter membrane. 

## The PCB board

## Bill of materials
- 2 10kOhm 1206 resistors
- 1 100nF 1206 capacitor
- 1 SHT45 sensirion sensor
